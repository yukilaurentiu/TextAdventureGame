# Text Adventure Game:world_map:
This is an interactive text game for beginners and I separated each function into each file to make more clean codes.

- Import modules, interact with the system and display text.
- Create a character sheet with functions, users input and variables.
- Add character skills performing operations on variables.
- Modify skills with random function using virtual die roll.
- Create functions to add story scenes and a choice mechanism
- Develop a combat system and run an encounter with a monster
- Compile Python for Mac and create an exe file
